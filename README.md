# Arabic-text-Prediction


This model was created as part of my graduation Project, we developed a RNN model capable of predicting the next word by giving it a sequance of words.  The idea behind it is to make a smartphobe's keyboard able to predict the user's next word. We used an open-source Keyboard but we modefied part of the code to make it predict words using RNN models. The model was trained on informal arabic tweets got from twitter.
